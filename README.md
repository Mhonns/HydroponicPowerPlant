# HydroponicPowerPlant
This is my first-year RND project including neural network and regression
using python script collaborating with Phupha Focus and Keane.

# Project Advisor
Dr. Paulo Garcia

# Supervisor
Mr.Kawisorn Kumtae

# Our Goal
To predict the growth rate of the lettuce given the growth factors.

# How to use 
There are two python files where you can use. 
predictorNN.py,  Run this file to predict the growth rate using a classic neural network.
predictorReg.py, Run this file to predict the growth rate using a nonlinear regression.

"RPI_Config" stores all raw input data
"Improper"   stores all raw input data which are improper to grow the plant.
